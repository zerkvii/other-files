 *It's my honor to be here for this interview.  First,please let me introduce myself briefly.My name is Liu Kai, 22 years old this year, from the ancient city Jingzhou, Hubei province. And I have graduated from Wuhan university of science and technology as an engineering mechanics major with certificates of CET4,  CET6, Second-level ï¼ŒThird-level Certificate of National Computer Rank Examination. During my college life, I am a student of many interests, my favorite sports are playing basketball and go sightseeing on a bicycle, besides participating in competition activities also excite me . I had taken part in mathematical modeling competitions, data mining competitions,and other activities, which I achieved good results. It's because of these activities related to computer that I gradually became interested in the field of computer science, and started to learn the knowledge associated.*

*Although I  have taken some courses in favor of computing such as the c language, FORTRAN language, maple programming and so on, I had to put that the study of modern object-oriented programming language is indeed a big challenge for me.But after a merely long time of practising ,I fianlly made my progress and find my self a sense of achivement*

 *But perhaps because I am not a computer science major and haven't learning computer science knowlege systematically,there are still some problems confusing me, thus I ve taught myself  computer organization,Operating system and so on, I also positively participate in activities about acm  and am on the top 100 in wustacm online judge . In the following days,I'll make great efforts to narrow the gap with other CS major fellows. That's all for my self-introduction. Thank you.*
